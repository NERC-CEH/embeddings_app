What methods were used to characterize the gut microbiome composition of the wood mice?, Bacterial DNA was extracted from faecal samples of wood mice and their gut microbiome was characterized by amplification and sequencing of the V3 region of bacterial 16S rRNA marker gene in 2017. 
What were the specific dates during which eddy covariance measurements were taken at the cropland and grassland sites?,"Eddy covariance measurements were taken at the cropland site between November 10th, 2016, and September 25th, 2018. At the grassland site, measurements were taken between April 27th, 2017, and March 31st, 2019. "
What methods were used to measure stream stage and water chemistry in the Hampshire Avon dataset?,Stream stage was measured using pressure transducers from Summer 2013 to Summer 2015. River water samples were collected at 48-hr intervals from Summer 2013 to Summer 2014 and analyzed for selected solutes and suspended sediment.  Manual measurements of discharge by the velocity-area method were also used to construct a stage-discharge relationship for each site.  
What are the four different genotypes of sugarcane plants used in this study?,"The four genotypes tested were: Saccharum officinarum L. cv. Badila, Saccharum spontaneum cv. Mandalay, Q240, and CTC4.  "
"What methods were used to analyze soil samples for nitrogen species (NH₄⁺, NO₂⁻, and NO₃⁻)?","  Soil slurries were created with field-moist soil and 2M KCl. These slurries were agitated on a continuous wheel shaker for 1 hour. After filtration through 0.2 μm nylon filters, the extracts were frozen and transported to the University of Birmingham, UK for analysis. Nitrogen species were determined using various methods:  
* NH₄⁺ was measured using the buffered hypochlorite method.
* NO₃⁻ was measured by cadmium column reduction to NO₂⁻ followed by a Griess diazotization reaction. 
* NO₂⁻ was also determined by a Griess diazotization reaction. Colorimetric analyses were performed on a Jenway 6800 UV/Vis spectrophotometer."
"How many trapping sessions were conducted over the course of the study, and during what months were they carried out?",A total of 46 trapping sessions were conducted from March to October in 2015-2017. The sessions took place approximately every two weeks.  
What are the spatial scales used in this study?,"The study used four different spatial scales: A = 1 quadrat only, B = 3 quadrats at 1 m to 10 m apart, C = 6 quadrats at 10 m to 100 m apart, and D = 12 quadrats at 100 m to 1000 m or site maximum.  "
What are the three attribute indicators of classification confidence provided in the land parcel dataset?,The land parcel dataset includes three attribute indicators of classification confidence. 
What were the specific dates when the plant cover observations were conducted?," Plant cover by species was sampled on three occasions in February 2018, July 2018, and January 2019.  "
